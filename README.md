# Connect-N

This is a command line game implemented in C++.  It is similar to Connect 4, except you can modify the main function to choose the size of the board and the number of pieces to connect.  There are three types of players, and you can choose two types of players to play against each other: a human player, a bad computer player, and a smart computer player.  The smart computer player uses the minimax algorithm to choose the optimal move to play.
